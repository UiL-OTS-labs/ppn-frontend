# Adult participant administration system FRONTEND

Adult participant administration system, written in Django.

## Introduction

This Django project is part of a two-application system used to keep track of 
adult participants, experiments and appointments for the UiL OTS Labs.

This project represents the frontend application, which is used by experiment 
leaders and participants.

## Requirements

* Python 3.9+ (3.8 might work, untested)
* Pip (for installing dependencies, see requirements.txt for details)
* A WSGI capable web server (not needed for development)
* A SQL database (tested with SQLite and MySQL)

## Installation

For production/acceptation deployment, please see our Puppet script. (Hosted on 
our private GitLab server).

Development instructions:
* Configure a working backend first!
* Clone this repository
* Install the dependencies using pip (it is recommended to use a virtual 
  environment!). ``pip install -r requirements.txt``
* Edit ``ppn_backend/settings.py`` to suit your needs. (Make sure you update the 
  backend location setting to your local setup!)
* Run all DB migrations ``python manage.py migrate``
* Compile the translation files using ``python manage.py compilemessages``
* You can now run a development server with ``python manage.py runserver``

The frontend does need a running backend to talk to! Otherwise it will be very 
unhelpful towards you.
As the ``runserver`` command defaults to using ``localhost:8000`` you will need 
to specify a different port for either the frontend or backend. You can change 
the port the application will listen on by specifying it as an argument.

For example: ``python manage.py runserver 9000`` will set the port used to 9000

## A note on dependencies
We use pip-tools to manage our dependencies (mostly to freeze the versions 
used). It's listed as a dependency, so it will be installed automatically.

``requirements.in`` lists the actual dependency and their version constraints. 
To update ``requirements.txt`` just run ``pip-compile -U``. Don't forget to test 
with the new versions!
